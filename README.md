# C/C++ Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when developing C/C++ code. I would be
glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! :thumbsup:

This pack includes:

- [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- [vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
- [Include Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ajshort.include-autocomplete)
- [C/C++ Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hars.CppSnippets)

If you find a extension really useful when developing python code and want to
improve this extension, feel free to [raise a issue](https://github.com/LeoJhonSong/Cpp-Extension-Pack/issues).
But please notice that **issues using the extensions included in this pack**
will not be accepted in this extension pack's repository:sweat_smile:.

**Enjoy!**
