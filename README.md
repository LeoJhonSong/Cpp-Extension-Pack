# C/C++ Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when developing C/C++ code. I would be
glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! 👍

❗️❗️❗️ before installation I suggest you read lines with ⚠️ tags first, where some requirements are mentioned.

🌟🌟🌟 Having trouble getting your VSCode ready for C/C++ developing?  
🌟🌟🌟 你正为在VSC中配置C/C++开发环境而头疼?  
I would be glad if [my little
tutorial](https://leojhonsong.github.io/2018/12/30/Configure-C-C-environment-in-VSCode/)
could help you. A [中文版本](https://leojhonsong.github.io/zh-CN/2018/12/30/%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AEVSCode%E4%B8%AD%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95C-C-%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83/)

## My tricks

Here are some tricks!😄

VSCode sometimes stucks when too many extensions are installed? Here are two
tricks:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select **Developer: Open
   Process Explorer** to see which extensions cost most. Then disable (just
   workspace) some extensions you don't need in current workspace.
2. thinks disable extensions one by one too annoying? you can disable a group
   of extensions by simply disable **a extension pack**! ✌️ Another good news is
   that you can uninstall any extension included in the pack while this extension
   pack is still there🎊
3. want to make your own extension pack? [This](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/03/07/extension-pack-roundup)
   may helps you👍
